========================================

CrispySystem was originally built so I would have to do less during my exams. Then I made it a public small basic framework.

The framework uses a MVC approach, which is achieved using: routing, controllers, models and views. It has Dependency Injection with auto-wiring which allows you to write no-mess code that just works.
